overview:
  intro: >-
    My research focuses on orographic precipitation and extreme rainfall in Taiwan associated with tropical cyclones. I combine polarimetric radar observations, rain gauges, and disdrometer observations to understand precipitation processes in mountainous regions.

      description: >-
        We investigate the orographic enhancement of precipitation as shallow convective clouds, located more than 100 km away from the center of Typhoon Chanthu, passed over the isolated Da-Tun Mountain in northern Taiwan.
        The enhancement mechanism appears to differ from the classical seeder-feeder process, and we aim to clarify the governing processes based on observational data.

      description: >-
        We provide observational evidence of the seeder-feeder effect associated with orographic precipitation over the isolated Da-Tun Mountain in northern Taiwan, under the influence of Typhoon Chanthuâ€™s outer rainbands and stratiform background precipitation.
        This study clarifies how differences in background precipitation modulate terrain-induced precipitation enhancement, with implications for improving the prediction of localized heavy rainfall events.
